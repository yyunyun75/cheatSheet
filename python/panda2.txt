print(dataFrame.head()) //print first few rows
.head() returns the first few rows (the “head” of the DataFrame).
.info() shows information on each of the columns, such as the data type and number of missing values.
.shape returns the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame.
.describe() calculates a few summary statistics for each column.
# Import pandas using the alias pd

# Print the values of homelessness
print(homelessness.values)

# Print the column index of homelessness
print(homelessness.columns)

# Print the row index of homelessness
print(homelessness.index)

# Sort homelessness by individuals
