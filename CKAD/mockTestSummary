// Helm
Team Mercury asked you to perform some operations using Helm, all in Namespace mercury:

Delete release internal-issue-report-apiv1
Upgrade release internal-issue-report-apiv2 to any newer version of chart bitnami/nginx available
Install a new release internal-issue-report-apache of chart bitnami/apache. The Deployment should have two replicas, set these via Helm-values during install
There seems to be a broken release, stuck in pending-install state. Find it and delete it

Helm Chart: Kubernetes YAML template-files combined into a single package, Values allow customisation
Helm Release: Installed instance of a Chart
Helm Values: Allow to customise the YAML template-files in a Chart when creating a Release

helm list - list release
helm uninstall [release name] -- delete release
helm repo list //list charts of teh repo
helm repo update //update charts
helm -n mercury install internal-issue-report-apache bitnami/apache --set replicaCount=2 // install release name internal... from char bitnami/pache, replica 2
helm show values bitnami/apache # will show a long list of all possible value-settings

//Label & annotation, multiple pods
k -n sun annotate pod -l protected=true protected="do not delete this pod" //add annotation for label protected=true
k -n sun label pod -l "type in (worker,runner)" protected=true //add label for pods with label worker/runner
